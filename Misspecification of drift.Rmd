The following notebook is written as an extension to the notebook AMOCestimation released as supplementary material to Ditlevsen et Al 2023.
THe purpose is to test the performance of the likelihood-based estimator of tipping time in a scenaria where the drift is misspecified.
To this end, we will simulate realizations from a model with double-well potential and use the likelihood of 3'rd degree polynomial model to estimate the tipping time and simulate the distribution of the estimator.
