The following notebook is written as an extension to the notebook AMOCestimation released as supplementaru material to Ditlevsen et Al 2023.
In particular we use the simulated traces to MC-estimate the true positive rate of the variance-, and autocorrelation-based EWS used in the article.
This is done for a grid of significance levels and their associated quantiles and observation times.
We will then simulate traces of the process under the "null hypothesis" where $\lambda(t) = \lambda_0$ to estimate false positive rates.
This is done for the same grid of significance levels and observation times.
Then for each observation time we plot the true positive rate vector against the false positive vector.
